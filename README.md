# MicroTrack-AI
MicroTrack AI helps users understand and reduce everyday plastic exposure that contributes to microplastic intake. By analyzing packaging materials and usage conditions, it estimates exposure risk, provides safety guidance, and encourages healthier, plastic-aware habits.
# MicroTrack AI

Hackathon prototype for tracking plastic exposure and reducing microplastic risk.

This project demonstrates core user flows such as scanning packaging, estimating exposure risk, and providing safer handling guidance.

Note: AI predictions are prototype-level and partially simulated for demo purposes.
